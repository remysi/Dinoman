Dinoman is an application for people who have interest in antique items. 
In Dinoman you can either bid for or sell your own antique items.   


**Navigation**

In Dinoman you can navigate between the other views by bottom tab navigator, hamburger icon drawer menu or just by clicking on auctions or buttons.


**All views in Dinoman:**

In Home view you can scroll through the five latest auctions and read a little about their description.
You'll also see when the auctions are going to end and their highest bids.

If you tap on any of the auctions you will be taken to the single view of that auction, where you can scroll through the information about the auction.

- **Main Auction**

Main Auction is where all of the auctions are listed from newest to oldest. In the future the plan is to implement filtering by the categories, bid amount and much more.

Main Auction works basically the same as in Home view. You can scroll through all of the auctions and tap on them to open up more information and to be able to bid for them.
